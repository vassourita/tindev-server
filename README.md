Tindev is a tinder-like app for developers developed by Rocketseat on a event called 'Omnistack Week' during June 2019

This repository is the server package for Tindev, but with changes i've made to practice some concepts i've never used before such as DDD, tests, dependency injection, orm's and a lot of other things

You can see the original version of Tindev [here](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/tindev)
